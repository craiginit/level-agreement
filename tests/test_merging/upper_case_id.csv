The shop was almost empty at 16: 30, which surprised me because it is located in a shopping center. The ordering process went smoothly and the lady at the checkout advised me to try the Cajun frieze. The burgers were delicious and cooked just right for me. However, I can imagine that they would have been too over the top for some. The Cajun friezes were delicious and not as spicy as I would have expected from the description of the lady at the checkout. The small portion was large enough for me. They tasted very intense like peanuts, which I hadn't noticed in other stores. The drinks machine with its huge selection is always great and the fact that there is free refill here in contrast to my tribe Five Guys at Disneyland Paris tops it all off.

  My family love Five Guys. We loved you before the pandemic and then your curbside collection became one of the few treats we could get (we live outside the deliveroo area) so you can imagine my disappointment tonight when you let us down for the first time ever. Our click and collect fries were nothing like your usual high standard. They were undercooked, limp, floppy and deeply unappetising. For the first time ever they went uneaten. I know this just isn't the way you like to present your food and not the experience you wanted us to have. I hope you can remedy this.

After repeatedly knocking and first ignoring the staff, someone opened the door. I showed my order. After a short call back, the employee told me to call FiveGuys and I would get the money back. There is nothing he can do about it. This was my first visit to Fiveguys, if you can call it that. I would be very happy to receive a reply and explanation. In the attachment you will find a screenshot of the email confirmation. If necessary, I can forward the email directly to you.
