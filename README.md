# Level Agreement Tool

## Description

The Level Agreement Tool is a tool designed to compare two sets of processed data: 'X' serving as the ground truth and 'Y' as the comparison set. The tool focuses on specific columns, namely [id, comments, prediction]. By utilizing this tool, users can merge the datasets and assess label differences effectively. It provides computed metrics that facilitate the identification of the more accurate and aligned dataset, aligning with the users' expectations. All data used for testing is augmented and generated.

## Features

- **Data Comparison:** Compare processed data sets 'X' and 'Y' based on specified columns.
- **Merged File Creation:** Generate a merged file to assess label differences and discrepancies.
- **Computed Metrics:** Utilize computed metrics to identify accurate and aligned datasets.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for seamless data comparison.

## Usage

1. **Input Data:**
   - Prepare two sets of processed data: 'X' (ground truth) and 'Y' (comparison set).
   - Ensure the data includes columns: [id, comments, prediction].

2. **Run the Tool:**
   - Use the tool to compare datasets and generate a merged file.
   - Analyze computed metrics to identify accurate and aligned data.
